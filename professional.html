			Can compost be a mechanism for creating more sustainable and resilient communities?
			This is the central question guiding this project, the result of a partnership between University of Michigan
			students and FoodPLUS|Detroit. As part of a capstone course, the culmination of a Masters in Urban and Regional
			Planning program, our team set out to identify opportunities, recognize challenges, and create recommendations
			to help guide planners, policy-makers, and community members from Detroit and beyond looking to reduce waste
			and create more sustainable and resilient communities.  A capstone course is a semester-long student-led,
			instructor-guided collaborative planning experience addressing real-world problems for a real-world client.
			The aim of a capstone is to mimic a professional work experience while being conducted as a learning experience.

			Mapping Informality in Khayelitsha
		</h2>
		<p id="location">
			<strong>Location</strong>: Cape Town, South Africa
		</p>

		<p id="team">
			<strong>Team members:</strong>
			Erin Cardwell, Jonathan Riley, Yujia Yang
		</p>
		<p id="responsibility">
			<strong>Responsibility </strong>:Spatial and data analysi, graphic design, contextual inquiry
		</p>
		<p>
			Khayelitsha is a peri-urban township situated on the outskirts of Cape Town. The most recent census was carried out in 2011 which reported a total number of 64,761‬ informal
			structures in areas designated orange in the above map. The outdated data does not illustrate the current situation in Khayelitsha. This mapping project aims to add on the
			scant of spatial analysis data by tracking the hot spots of informal structures and providing percentages of formal/informal building footprints. Maps and numbers generated
			from the process will be used to identify the trend of change in informal structures.
			With this knowledge acquired through spatial analysis, people would be able to further dig into the driving force of the increase of informal building footprint makeup.
